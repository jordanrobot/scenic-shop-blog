    <h4><a href="/mark6/posts/2009/2009-05-25-mirrored-flats-a-learning-experience/">Mirrored Flats: A Learning Experience</a></h4>
    Found out a couple of pitfalls when building flats with mirrored acrylic skins. Our usual acrylic adhesive is a two part methacrylate based adhesive. It works incredibly well when bonding acrylic to just about any substrate (steel, wood, other plastics…) Some formulations cure to a relatively clear finish, which is quite the selling point. Unfortunately, we found that methacrylates will distort the mirror coating on mirrored plexi. Whoops. You can see the distortion in the picture below.... <br />

    <h4><a href="/mark6/posts/2009/2009-04-09-slick-edging/">Slick Edging</a></h4>
    Here’s another choice for edging a deck and other scenic elements: paper. We recently did a production of Bad Dates and the designer wanted a smooth black finish for the “cut” edges of the walls and deck. Since the audience was sitting only four feet from the set, we experimented with wallpapering with a 50# black kraft paper. The advantages were as follows.
 the paper is thin enough to make the edges very clean the texture was very flat, smooth and consistent - much like bristol board.... <br />

    <h4><a href="/mark6/posts/2009/2009-04-09-stock-power-supplies-for-effects/">Stock Power Supplies for Effects</a></h4>
    Here’s a quick post on using computer power supplies to power DC effects.
Pull a power supply out of a computer and go to town! The most common computer power supplies (ATX form factor) provide several different DC voltages, such as &#43;3v, -3v, &#43;5v, -5v, &#43;12v, and -12v. Mix and match between those specific wires or the common and you’ve got most of your onstage effects covered. For example, for our current show we’re using the &#43;12v and -12v leads to power several 24v solenoid valves.... <br />

    <h4><a href="/mark6/posts/2009/2009-03-01-cadalyzer-autocad-command-counter/">CADalyzer (AutoCAD Command Counter)</a></h4>
    I’ve been working on a Ruby utility to analyze AutoCAD log files. The goal is to count how many times each command is invoked. The basic functionality is all in place, I’ve plans to add more in-depth analysis and perhaps even turn it into a web based tool. For now, you’ll have to download it and run it in the command line. If you want to run this, you’ll need the Ruby programming language runtime installed on your computer.... <br />

    <h4><a href="/mark6/posts/2009/2009-03-01-introducing-a-stagecraft-wiki/">Introducing A Stagecraft Wiki</a></h4>
    I’m starting a functional Stagecraft Wiki for theatre technicians. You will find it at wiki.scenic-shop.com
For those of you in the know, the past few years I have been wrestling with creating a community based resource for theatre technicians. Now the same software that runs Wikipedia is being used to manage a wiki by theatremakers, for theatremakers.
For those of you who worry about such things, the wiki’s content is (and will remain) free to all.... <br />

    <h4><a href="/mark6/posts/2009/2009-02-16-load-wheels/">Load Wheels</a></h4>
    File this under great hardware finds. - I needed low-profile, high capacity wheels for an effect and stumbled onto these. They are load wheels for a pallet jack (the wheels pictured are Crown part number 44506 / McMaster 2670T58. The yellow caster mounts are shop built.)
44506 Load wheel specs:
 2500 lbs load rating! 3” diameter x 3 7/8” wide Roller ball bearings Shore 90A polyurethane tread Slightly oversized 3/4” shaft (about 25/32”) $30 each from Mcmaster $45 each from a Crown distributor (price will undoubtably vary)  What makes these attractive?... <br />

    <h4><a href="/mark6/posts/2009/2009-02-05-good-math-links/">(Good) Math Links</a></h4>
    Ever wish you were better at math? Me too. I’ve been teaching myself calculus and stumbled on Better Explained, a blog with excellent math explanations. The author’s aim is to make math concepts intuitive. Now I actually understand what the imaginary number ‘i’ is all about; it wasn’t hard at all.
Sure most people think math is boring, but that’s because they probably don’t really “get” it. Don’t worry, it’s not your fault you don’t enjoy math.... <br />
