      <description>InventorShims is a collection of vb.net code to extend and add common API methods and classes to Autodesk Inventor&amp;rsquo;s existing API.
From simplified methods to interact with iproperties and parameters, to generic methods to return the pertinent document object from a supplied Inventor object type, InventorShims aims to create a library of frequently used methods and classes. These are organized by area of concern, into seperate files; load only what you need.</description>
