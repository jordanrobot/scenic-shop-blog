      <description>Some Calculator updates:
I&amp;rsquo;ve finished an ANSI Chain Calculator; you&amp;rsquo;ll find it in the main index. It calculates the following:
 Physical properties of standard ANSI chains (multi-strands too), Pitch length to inch length converter Estimated chain elongation calculation Estimated chain weight per length of selected chain Center-to-center calculators for a two-sprocket system, calculating by sprocket centers or by chain length Sprocket properties for the selected chain size, including pitch diameter, outside diameter, and tooth width.</description>

      <description>Yes, I&amp;rsquo;m still alive. No, I haven&amp;rsquo;t posted in over a year. Yes, I&amp;rsquo;m still working for a large live entertainment company.
A quick update, the earlier calculator scripts that I mentioned in the last few posts are no longer working. I&amp;rsquo;ve instead been working on a unified collection of calculators using the jquery mobile framework; the aim is to be phone and tablet friendly. Catch it in the links above, or here.</description>

      <description>I just updated my frustum calculator to two javascript versions. One will calculate the flattened frustum from the radii, the other uses the circumferences of the frustum shape.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with learning javascript recently. I&amp;rsquo;ve thrown together a fluid power calculator as a &amp;ldquo;hello world&amp;rdquo;. You can find it here: Fluid Power Calculator It&amp;rsquo;s not pretty, but it works pretty well. (See what I did there?) You can download the page and run it locally if you want.
My ultimate goal is to transfer all of my theatre-related excel calculators to javascript powered web pages, so I can access them wherever I happen to be.</description>

      <description>Update: I just updated this frustum calculator with javascript versions that will run from the browser. One will calculate the flattened frustum from the radii, the other uses the circumferences of the frustum shape.
