      <description>Designed for use with Autodesk&amp;rsquo;s Inventor iLogic scripts and Autocad LISP files, Collector is intended to allow use of external IDEs such as Visual Studio and support class or module-per-file coding organization.
This is handy for autolisp routines as well, as they can be stored in seperate files but combined into a single lisp file.
It is also useful when developing an Inventor Add-In and you want to perform testing in the iLogic environment.</description>
