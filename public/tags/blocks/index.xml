      <description>I just realized I never posted those grand piano cad blocks I promised months ago. You can snag them here (version 2k). Egg. face. mine.

      <description>Looking for a collection of the Dykes Lumber moulding profiles in CAD format? Here you go.
Download the Dykes Moulding file here. (381 kb)
The profiles have been compiled into a single file, each profile a separate block. (Design Center users rejoice!) This file is in v2000 format. Much thanks goes to Adam Godbout for providing the file.
Happy CADDing.
Edit: The following download contains the collection of Dykes profiles in individual dxf files.</description>
