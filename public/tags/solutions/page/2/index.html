    <h4><a href="/mark6/posts/2009/2009-11-11-mechanism-resources/">Mechanism Resources</a></h4>
    This one’s for the mech heads and purveyors of fine machinery.
Cornell University’s Reuleaux Collection is a collection of 220 machines. The machines include various crank mechanisms, couplings, linkages, compound gearing… the list goes on. The website itself is a catalogue of the 19th century machines - some with accompanying videos and technical documentation. In my opinion, the machines themselves are functional, beautifully crafted works of art; they deserve some attention.... <br />

    <h4><a href="/mark6/posts/2009/2009-05-25-mirrored-flats-a-learning-experience/">Mirrored Flats: A Learning Experience</a></h4>
    Found out a couple of pitfalls when building flats with mirrored acrylic skins. Our usual acrylic adhesive is a two part methacrylate based adhesive. It works incredibly well when bonding acrylic to just about any substrate (steel, wood, other plastics…) Some formulations cure to a relatively clear finish, which is quite the selling point. Unfortunately, we found that methacrylates will distort the mirror coating on mirrored plexi. Whoops. You can see the distortion in the picture below.... <br />

    <h4><a href="/mark6/posts/2009/2009-04-09-slick-edging/">Slick Edging</a></h4>
    Here’s another choice for edging a deck and other scenic elements: paper. We recently did a production of Bad Dates and the designer wanted a smooth black finish for the “cut” edges of the walls and deck. Since the audience was sitting only four feet from the set, we experimented with wallpapering with a 50# black kraft paper. The advantages were as follows.
 the paper is thin enough to make the edges very clean the texture was very flat, smooth and consistent - much like bristol board.... <br />

    <h4><a href="/mark6/posts/2009/2009-04-09-stock-power-supplies-for-effects/">Stock Power Supplies for Effects</a></h4>
    Here’s a quick post on using computer power supplies to power DC effects.
Pull a power supply out of a computer and go to town! The most common computer power supplies (ATX form factor) provide several different DC voltages, such as &#43;3v, -3v, &#43;5v, -5v, &#43;12v, and -12v. Mix and match between those specific wires or the common and you’ve got most of your onstage effects covered. For example, for our current show we’re using the &#43;12v and -12v leads to power several 24v solenoid valves.... <br />

    <h4><a href="/mark6/posts/2009/2009-02-16-load-wheels/">Load Wheels</a></h4>
    File this under great hardware finds. - I needed low-profile, high capacity wheels for an effect and stumbled onto these. They are load wheels for a pallet jack (the wheels pictured are Crown part number 44506 / McMaster 2670T58. The yellow caster mounts are shop built.)
44506 Load wheel specs:
 2500 lbs load rating! 3” diameter x 3 7/8” wide Roller ball bearings Shore 90A polyurethane tread Slightly oversized 3/4” shaft (about 25/32”) $30 each from Mcmaster $45 each from a Crown distributor (price will undoubtably vary)  What makes these attractive?... <br />

    <h4><a href="/mark6/posts/2009/2009-01-21-roll-bender-wheels/">Roll Bender Wheels</a></h4>
    Danger Will Robinson! The cast iron wheels pictured below are the ones that were spec’ed in Keith Cornelius’s 1997 Tech Expo article_An Inexpensive, Human-Powered Roll-Former_. (Grainer part numbers are #3G262 and #3G263.) Obviously they’ve changed a little bit since 1997; the new “feature” is a crown to the surface of the wheel. Unless you’re looking to mangle your steel whilst bending, I suggest you find flatter wheels.
I suggest finding flatter iron wheels through Mcmaster-Carr.... <br />

    <h4><a href="/mark6/posts/2008/2008-12-15-additional-porta-band-thoughts/">Additional Porta-band Thoughts</a></h4>
    Quick thought on the porta-band stand described in an earlier post, mounting the saw to the vice-mount takes a couple of minutes. You could make a smaller custom foot that always stays on the saw and “dovetails” into the vice mount. A single machine screw could be used to secure the small foot to the mount. This way the saw could go from case to vice (and back again) in under 30 seconds.... <br />

    Ian made this custom foot for the Porta-band that clamps into the vice this past week. Its 3/8” cold roll plate with a bit of scrap 1x box tube welded to the underside. A spring clamp on the trigger acts as a low tech on/off switch. .... <br />
