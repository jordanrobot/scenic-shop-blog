Scratch! has been updated to version 0.8.

[Download Scratch! v.8](https://scenic-shop.com/files/cad/scratch0.8.zip)

This version adds a couple of features and bug-fixes:

- The AutoCAD text window no longer pops up when running the EST command.  Thank goodness, that was annoying.
- A new confirmation (with a cool view of all items on the temporary layer) has been added to the EST command.  This allows you to see what you are deleting before you do.  If you want to empty the temporary layer without the confirmation, you can use the EST\` command.
- If the temporary layer is off or frozen when invoked, it is automatically thawed and turned on.

For those of you who don't know what I'm talking about, Scratch! is an Autolisp utility for AutoCAD that provides a quick & simple way to utilize a temporary scratchpad layer. Scratch allows you to quickly switch in & out of the scratchpad layer, and empty it away whenever you want.  You can read more about it at the original article, [Scratch! (an AutoCAD Scratchpad Utility)](https://scenic-shop.com/wp/2009/11/scratch-an-autocad-scratchpad-utility/)
