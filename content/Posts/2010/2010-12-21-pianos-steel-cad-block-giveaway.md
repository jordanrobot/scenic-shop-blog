I just realized I never posted those grand piano cad blocks I promised months ago.  [You can snag them here](https://scenic-shop.com/files/cad/Blocks/Pianos.dwg) (version 2k).  Egg. face. mine.

While I'm at it - [this is a link](https://scenic-shop.com/files/cad/Blocks/SteelProfiles.dwg) to some commonly used steel profile blocks.  Some of them are dynamic, so you'll need a newer (2006? I'm too lazy to look it up right now) version of autocad to utilize them.  Inside you'll find:

- Common (small) rectangular tubing (d-d-d-d-dynamic!)
- Angle Iron (dynamic)
- 1 5/8" Unistrut
- 280 Track
- Iron Pipe (dynamic)
- 2x4 metal stud
