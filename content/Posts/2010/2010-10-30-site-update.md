For the three people who keep up with this blog, you've probably noticed that I haven't updated at all in the past several months.  Sorry about that - I've recently taken an engineering gig for [Production Resource Group](http://prg.com)'s scene shop, which includes confidentiality agreements and such.  At this point I'm not sure what is and isn't considered a trade secret, so I'm holding off on posting any solutions derived from work.  Its a shame, I've always been of the mind that information should be free, especially in the theatre.  Ah the price we pay for growing up and moving on to bigger things.  This blog will continue, but it will probably shift even more to AutoCAD related scripts and such.  Now that I'm working at a different shop I've been drafting different stuff, and have a boatload of new ideas.  I've already started work on several routines; they'll be up when they're fit for public consumption.
