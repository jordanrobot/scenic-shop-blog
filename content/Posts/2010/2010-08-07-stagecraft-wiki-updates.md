Good news, I recently added some anti-spam measures to the [Stagecraft Wiki](http://wiki.scenic-shop.com), and as a result have re-enabled anonymous editing.  This means you don't need to login to share your brilliant ideas!  (Hint, hint)

I've also added a few more pages.  Our upcoming show has a grand piano, so I've thrown some research up at [piano dimensions](http://scenic-shop.com/wiki/index.php/Piano_Dimensions).  I'll add some cad blocks for the various sizes in a bit.

Also [metal tube gauges](http://scenic-shop.com/wiki/index.php/Metal_Tube_Gauges), [cord locks](http://scenic-shop.com/wiki/index.php/Cord_Lock), [arboron](http://scenic-shop.com/wiki/index.php/Arboron), and [low tack adhesives](http://scenic-shop.com/wiki/index.php/Low_Tack_Adhesive).
