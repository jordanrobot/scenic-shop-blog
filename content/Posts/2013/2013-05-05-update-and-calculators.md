Yes, I'm still alive.  No, I haven't posted in over a year.  Yes, I'm still working for a large live entertainment company.

A quick update, the earlier calculator scripts that I mentioned in the last few posts are no longer working.  I've instead been working on a unified collection of calculators using the jquery mobile framework; the aim is to be phone and tablet friendly.   Catch it in the links above, or [here](https://scenic-shop.com/Calculators/index.html).

My two favorites are the Unit Converter and the HP/Force/Speed estimator.  I'll be adding more as I find the time.
