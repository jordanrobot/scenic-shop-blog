While I do work primarily in the entertainment industry, I like to keep an eye on the larger world of CAD news.  Here's the current list of CAD related blogs I keep up with...

[Design and Motion](http://designandmotion.net/)

[SolidSmack](http://solidsmack.com/) - Product Design, CAD, Prototyping, etc.  Of EvD Media fame, highly recommend their podcast, [Engineer Vs. Designer](http://engineervsdesigner.com/).  Oh, note to self, podcasts are a post for the future...

[MasterGraphics blog](http://www.mastergraphics.com/wordpress) - these guys have some good tips and tricks, found them while searching from info on Inventor tips.

[Lazy Drafter](http://www.lazydrafter.com/)

[CAD Insider](http://cadinsider.typepad.com/) - This one goes way out of my discipline, but its still interesting to read up on general industry and CAD/CAM/CAE news

[The CAD Setter Out](http://cadsetterout.com/)

 

Autodesk Personnel

[Ellen Finkelstein's Blog](http://www.ellenfinkelstein.com/acadblog/) - Usually more basic tips, but every once and a while there's an obscure bit.

[Heidi Hwewtt's Blog](heidihewett.blogs.com) - heidihewett.blogs.com

[Between the Lines](http://autodesk.blogs.com/) - from Shaan Hurley

[Through the Interface](http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/) - Coding (mostly in .net) for Autodesk products, from Kean Walmsley
