[The Lazy Drafter](http://www.lazydrafter.com/). I stumbled across this site a few days ago. As I am a lazy drafter myself, I’m already a big fan. If you work in AutoCAD, consider it recommended reading.

For those who enjoyed the post on imperial & Metric Conversions, I’ll recommend this [post](http://www.lazydrafter.com/autocad-tips/automatic-scaling-of-blocks-images-xrefs/) ([Automatic Scaling](http://www.lazydrafter.com/autocad-tips/automatic-scaling-of-blocks-images-xrefs/)...), it compliments mine nicely.
