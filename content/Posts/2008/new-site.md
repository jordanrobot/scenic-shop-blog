You may remember the Theatre Mysteries Project. Oh, that site died a slow death of neglect. The coup de gr√¢ce came when I decided not to renew the domain registration. So I packed up, moved across town, and set up shop somewhere else. I feel liberated from the constant self-nagging to keep the old site updated with new bits. The TMP was for other people, this one is for me. I have decided to narrow my focus and write articles documenting projects that I am currently or have previously worked on. This will also serve as a place for me to house files pertinent to my work. Perhaps I'll throw down a blog or two every once and a while.
