Recently designed a radio play for the Long Wharf Theatre Radio Auction. Unfortunately air time became limited, so we could only broadcast one six minute scene. Good new everybody! The play is available for download here. Downloads as zipped MP3s.[80Days.zip](http://www.scenic-shop.com/files/audio/80Days/80Days.zip)

The Long Wharf Radio Theatre Presents: Around the World in 80 Days. Adapted from the Orson Wells' Mercury Theatre Radio play (based on Jules Verne's book by the same title.)
