Quick thought on the porta-band stand described in [an earlier post](http://www.scenic-shop.com/ss/files/portaband_stand.html "Home:Porta-band Stand on the Cheap"), mounting the saw to the vice-mount takes a couple of minutes. You could make a smaller custom foot that always stays on the saw and “dovetails” into the vice mount. A single machine screw could be used to secure the small foot to the mount. This way the saw could go from case to vice (and back again) in under 30 seconds.
