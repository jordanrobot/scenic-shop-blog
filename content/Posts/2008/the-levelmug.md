I love coffee. I also love levels. What would be better than a coffee-mug level? The LevelMug® is the perfect mutli-tool intended for spot checking scenery & frustrating your carpenters between production meetings. Once filled with coffee or tea LevelMug®’s proprietary precision ground MugMarks® allow you to quickly estimate level to within 2.5 degrees. Note: Only use the LevelMug® in the vertical and horizontal planes. Especially when it’s filled with hot coffee. You know, like that time you dropped by the MacDonalds drive thru for a quick cup of joe. You won’t put that in your lap again, will you?

I’m sending in the patent application this very moment.
