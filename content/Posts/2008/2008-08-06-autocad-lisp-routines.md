I’ve thrown a few of my most frequently used LISP routines on here. You’ll find the files & descriptions [here](http://scenic-shop.com/ss/ss/CAD/LISPs.html "aCAD LISPs"). I will be adding more as I clean them up and determine where I acquired them (so I can give credit where credit is due.) I am also tinkering with the idea of posting my pgp file; while not especially useful, I am always interested to see what shortcuts other people use. Perhaps someone out there feels the same way. I’ll think about that while you root around in the LISPs directory.
