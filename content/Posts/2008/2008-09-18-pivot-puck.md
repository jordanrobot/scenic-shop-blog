![pivotPuck](../images/pivotPuck.jpg "pivotPuck") We need to pivot a few masking walls for our upcoming production of _Hughie._ So this little UHMW bugger was born; I like to call it a pivot puck. Screw the puck to a surface and place a shaft in it (our shaft is welded to plate steel that bears on the top surface of the puck) and you’ve got an instant pivot point! (Just make sure the screw heads are countersunk below the surface.) It’s so sexy that it may become a regular stock item in our inventory. I will post an update after we use them for the show.
