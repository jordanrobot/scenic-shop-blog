Go go West Virginia. I’m back at the Contemporary American Theatre Festival in Shepherdstown, WV for the summer. Its amazing how much life is put on hold during summer stock. Unfortunately there are not any outlandish scenic requirements. Though the schedule is outlandish in its own right. That’s the summer stock life for ya’. The shows are fairly straightforward, though we are using a ridiculous amount of blood this summer, which should make changeovers bundles o’ fun. I’ll post some pictures later on.
