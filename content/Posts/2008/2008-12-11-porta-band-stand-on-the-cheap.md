Ian made this custom foot for the [Porta-band](http://www.milwaukeetool.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/product_27_40028_-1_684434_192206_192137) that clamps into the vice this past week. Its 3/8” cold roll plate with a bit of scrap 1x box tube welded to the underside. A spring clamp on the trigger acts as a low tech on/off switch. .![Portaband_Stand2](images/page1_blog_entry21_1.jpg)
