I've been playing around with learning javascript recently.  I've thrown together a fluid power calculator as a "hello world".  You can find it here: [Fluid Power Calculator](https://scenic-shop.com/Calculators/CylinderCalc.html) It's not pretty, but it works pretty well.  (See what I did there?)  You can download the page and run it locally if you want.

My ultimate goal is to transfer all of my theatre-related excel calculators to javascript powered web pages, so I can access them wherever I happen to be.
