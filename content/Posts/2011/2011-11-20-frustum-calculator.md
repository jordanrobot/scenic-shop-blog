I just updated my frustum calculator to two javascript versions.Â  One will calculate the flattened frustum from the [radii,](https://www.scenic-shop.com/Calculators/frustum_flatten.html#radius_page) the other uses the [circumferences](https://www.scenic-shop.com/Calculators/frustum_flatten.html) of the frustum shape.
