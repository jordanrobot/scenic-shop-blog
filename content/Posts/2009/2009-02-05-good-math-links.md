Ever wish you were better at math? Me too. I’ve been teaching myself calculus and stumbled on [Better Explained](http://betterexplained.com/), a blog with excellent math explanations. The author’s aim is to make math concepts intuitive. Now I actually understand what the imaginary number ‘i’ is all about; it wasn’t hard at all.

Sure most people think math is boring, but that’s because they probably don’t really “get” it. Don’t worry, it’s not your fault you don’t enjoy math. For those of us who endured a crappy (though deemed “standard”) math education, I point you to an article by Paul Lockhart called _[A Mathematician’s Lament](http://www.maa.org/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf)_[.](http://www.maa.org/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf) In it he describes the failings of the current K-12 math educational system. I felt both vindicated and angry as I read it. This is absolutely required reading.
