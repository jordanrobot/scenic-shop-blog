This one's for the mech heads and purveyors of fine machinery.

[Cornell University’s Reuleaux Collection](http://kmoddl.library.cornell.edu/model.php?m=reuleaux) is a collection of 220 machines.  The machines include various crank mechanisms, couplings, linkages, compound gearing... the list goes on.  The website itself is a catalogue of the 19th century machines - some with accompanying videos and technical documentation.  In my opinion, the machines themselves are functional, beautifully crafted works of art; they deserve some attention.

There are also three books that I highly recommend all mech heads have on a shelf somewhere.  Or in the powder room (your choice, no judgement here).

_[507 Mechanical Movements](http://www.amazon.com/507-Mechanical-Movements-Mechanisms-Devices/dp/9650060219/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1257725475&sr=8-7)__[: Mechanisms and Devices](http://www.amazon.com/507-Mechanical-Movements-Mechanisms-Devices/dp/9650060219/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1257725475&sr=8-7)_ by  Henry T. Brown

- This slim paperback from 1868 is as simple as it gets: 507 drawings of various mechanisms, and text that describes their operations and uses.

_[Machine Devices and Components Illustrated Sourcebook](http://www.amazon.com/Machine-Devices-Components-Illustrated-Sourcebook/dp/0071436871/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1257725475&sr=8-6)_ by Robert Parmley

- This bad boy is a compendium of 1,500 different mechanisms.  It's broken down into assemblies, power transmission, and mechanical components.  A great way to kick start the brain when you need some inspiration.

_[Mechanisms and Mechanical Devices Sourcebook](http://www.amazon.com/Mechanisms-Mechanical-Devices-Sourcebook-Fourth/dp/0071467610/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1257725475&sr=8-1)_ by Neil Sclater and Nicholas Chironis.

- This 500 page beast is a good companion to the _Machine Devices and Components_... title listed above.  I like to think of it as the sequel.

Of course there is [Mechanical Design for the Stage](http://www.amazon.com/Mechanical-Design-Stage-Alan-Hendrickson/dp/024080631X/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1257727280&sr=1-4) by Alan Hendrickson, but I know you already own that one, right?

Note that the book links go to Amazon pages, I'm not saying you should buy from Amazon, in fact I recommend saving a few bucks and getting used copies.
