Looking for a collection of the Dykes Lumber moulding profiles in CAD format? Here you go.

[Download the Dykes Moulding file here.](https://www.scenic-shop.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Dykes-Moulding.dwg.zip) (381 kb)

The profiles have been compiled into a single file, each profile a separate block. (Design Center users rejoice!) This file is in v2000 format. Much thanks goes to Adam Godbout for providing the file.

Happy CADDing.

**Edit**: The following download contains the collection of Dykes profiles in individual dxf files. These profiles aren't saved as blocks, just as raw geometry.
