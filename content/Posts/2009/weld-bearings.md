You need small, ad hoc, weld-on bearings?  Check this out.  Use a plastic bushing, a shaft collar and a cone-point socket set screw.  Weld the shaft collar over a hole, and keep the plastic bushing in place with the set screw (the cone point is key).  Feel free to add a little threadlocker if you're paranoid.  Works like a charm.
