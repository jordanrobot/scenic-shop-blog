Update:  I just updated this frustum calculator with javascript versions that will run from the browser.  One will calculate the flattened frustum from the [radii](http://www.scenic-shop.com/Calculators/frustum_flatten.html#radius_page), the other uses the [circumferences](http://www.scenic-shop.com/Calculators/frustum_flatten.html) of the frustum shape.

Have you ever wanted to lay out the frustum of a cone on a flat surface?” _“A what?”_ “A frustum, the part of a cone that is left when you lop off the top.” “_Oh, yeah. If I had a nickel... sadly, I’m still poor._”

It can be a little intimidating if you’re not familiar with the concept of how to go about it. Our draper came to me wondering how she could accurately lay out a dress based on an actor’s measurements. (Apparently the traditional layout method wastes fabric.) So I came up with this simple excel sheet that does the calculations based on the following measurements: waist (small circumference), hem (large circumference) & inseam (height of the frustum.) It gives back the details needed to lay the cone frustum out on a flat surface. The diagram below gives the general gist of what’s what. There is a larger version of the image in the excel document.

Update: There is a great [description](http://www.woodweb.com/knowledge_base/Creating_the_Flat_View_of_a_Cone.html) of how to flatten a frustum in AutoCAD over at Woodweb.
