I'm starting a functional Stagecraft Wiki for theatre technicians. You will find it atÂ [wiki.scenic-shop.com](http://wiki.scenic-shop.com/)

For those of you in the know, the past few years I have been wrestling with creating a community based resource for theatre technicians. Now the same software that runs Wikipedia is being used to manage a wiki by theatremakers, for theatremakers.

For those of you who worry about such things, the wiki's content is (and will remain) free to all.

Now all we need is a community of technicians to create and evolve the wiki's content. I invite you to share your cool materials, solutions, and unique perspectives. I invite you to create a valuable resource for theatre technicians everywhere. I invite you to participate.
