Is this the littlest track dog ever?  Perhaps.  Either way, it's sooo cute!  This prototype track dog measures in at 3/4" x 15/32" x 3.5" and is milled from a solid chunk of UHMW.  (Ignore the oily grime, its fresh off the bridgeport.) The 1/8" aircraft cable is secured with two set screws in the opposite face of the dog.  I'm thinking the mark 2 will feature a sandwich style construction with a fixed knife.  Stay tuned for later revisions to this project.
