InventorShims is a collection of vb.net code to extend and add common API methods and classes to Autodesk Inventor's existing API.

From simplified methods to interact with iproperties and parameters, to generic methods to return the pertinent document object from a supplied Inventor object type, InventorShims aims to create a library of frequently used methods and classes.  These are organized by area of concern, into seperate files; load only what you need.
